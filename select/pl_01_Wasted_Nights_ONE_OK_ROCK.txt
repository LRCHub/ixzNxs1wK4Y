Must be something in
the water
Feel like I can take
the world
Throw the weight up on
My shoulders
‘cause I won’t even feel
the burn
Don’t be afraid to dive
Be afraid that you
didn’t try
These moments remind
us why
We are here, we’re
So alive
Let’s live like we’re
immortal
Maybe just for tonight
We’ll think about
Tomorrow
When the sun comes up
‘Cause by this time
tomorrow
We’ll be talking about
tonight
Keep doing what we
want we want we want
No more wasted nights
ただ過ぎ行く時間に
気を止める必要はない
何かを失えば
また何か手にする
Don’t be afraid to dive
何もせずはもっと怖い
These moments remind
us why
ここで生きる意味は…
Let’s live like we’re
immortal
Maybe just for tonight
We’ll think about
tomorrow
When the sun comes up
‘Cause by this time
tomorrow
We’ll be talking about
tonight
Keep doing what we
want we want we want
No more wasted nights
I don’t wanna wait
I don’t wanna waste
a night
I don’t wanna wait
I don’t wanna waste
a night
I don’t wanna wait
I don’t wanna waste
a night
I don’t wanna wait
I don’t wanna waste
a night
Let’s live like we’re
immortal
Maybe just for tonight
We’ll think about
tomorrow
When the sun comes up
‘Cause by this time
tomorrow
We’ll be talking about
tonight
Keep doing what we
want we want we want
No more wasted nights
I don’t wanna wait
I don’t wanna waste
a night
I don’t wanna wait
No more waste nights
