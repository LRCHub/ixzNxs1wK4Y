Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind
For you don't belong to me
Your heart belongs to someone else

Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name
When you're the blame for making me blue
Don't you remember the day
That you went away and left me
I was a lonly, right for you only, my love

Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true
Why should I call your name
When you're the one to blame for making me blue

Don't you remember the day
That you went away

Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true
Why should I call your name
When you're the one to blame for making me blue

Wasted days and wasted nights
Why I left for you behind
And why should I call your name
When you're the blame for making me blue
Don't you remember the day
That you went away
I was a lonly, right for you only, my love

Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind
For you don't belong to me
Your heart belongs to someone else

Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind

Wasted days and wasted nights
Wasted days and wasted nights
