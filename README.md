[00:17.78] Must be something in the water
[00:21.03] Feel like I can take the world
[00:25.33] Throw the weight up on my shoulders
[00:28.78] Cause I won't even feel the burn
[00:44.78] 
[00:32.66] Don't be afraid to dive
[00:35.92] Be afraid that you didn't try
[00:39.87] These moments remind us why
[00:43.72] We're here, we're so alive
[00:56.72] 
[00:46.96] Let's live like we're immortal
[00:50.90] Live just for tonight
[00:54.87] We'll think about tomorrow, yeah
[00:58.33] When the sun comes up
[01:02.26] Cause by this time tomorrow
[01:06.66] We'll be talking about tonight
[01:10.11] Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
[01:13.69] No more wasted nights
[01:24.19] 
[01:19.53] ただ過ぎゆく時間に気を留める必要はない
[01:27.02] 何かを失えば、また何か手にする
[01:34.17] Don't be afraid to dive
[01:37.02] 何もせずはもっと怖い
[01:41.33] These moments remind us why
[01:44.74] ここで生きる意味を
[01:49.24] 
[01:48.33] Let's live like we're immortal
[01:52.79] Live just for tonight
[01:56.29] We'll think about tomorrow, yeah
[01:59.59] When the sun comes up
[02:03.66] Cause by this time tomorrow
[02:07.86] We'll be talking about tonight
[02:11.43] Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
[02:14.65] No more wasted nights
[02:25.15] 
[02:20.34] I don't wanna wait, I don't want to waste a night
[02:27.72] I don't wanna wait, I don't want to waste a night
[02:35.47] I don't wanna wait, I don't want to waste a night
[02:42.98] I don't wanna wait, I don't want to waste a night
[03:07.48]
